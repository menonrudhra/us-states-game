# us-states-game
A game to name all the states of US using Python Turtle


## Overview
In this game, we have an image of the US map with all of the states blanked out. The player will try to guess as many names of the states of the US as they can by looking at the shape of the map and by remembering what the states look like. And once they've entered the name and hit OK, then if it actually exists, the name gets added to the map. Try to guess all 50!
